# ChatGPT VSCode Extension Project
HCiQuery is a query analysis software that includes a plugin for VSCode that allows for the saved interaction 
between user and ChatGPT and also the saved real-time code that the user types. The goal of HCiQuery is to be 
able to look at and understand the best way of structuring a query in order to utilize artificial 
intelligence engines, such as ChatGPT, to the best of your ability.
This project will have four main stages. The VSCode plug-in enables the capturing of user data, the database 
to grab and store the query data, an in-depth analysis of the extracted data, and finally, a way of 
visualizing the data and explaining the findings to both researchers and developers. At a high level, the 
user will dynamically interact with ChatGPT while simultaneously typing code in the editor, while in the 
background all of their queries and written code will be saved into the database to be later analyzed by a 
researcher, developer or data scientist.
